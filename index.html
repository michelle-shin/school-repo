    In July, I worked full-time at a hotel as a reservation agent. 
    The hotel was extremely busy with local travellers. 
    I also visited Whistler with my friends. We did hiking and ziplining. 
    <strong>I can't wait to visit again next summer!</strong>

    I <em>hate</em> celery. People say it has no taste, but I can still taste it.
    Celery has a weird texture. Although celery is one of the healthiest food, 
    I prefer not having it.

<p>Three courses I am taking:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ACIT-1630 Database Systems</li>
    <li>ACIT-1420 Intro to System Admin</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20213048467/">
        ACIT-1620 Fundamental Web Technologies</a></li>
</ul>
